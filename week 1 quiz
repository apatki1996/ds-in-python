1. What does f(1782818) return, for the following function definition:

def f(x):
  d=0
  while x > 1:
    (d,x) = (d+1,x/10)
  return(d)

2. What is the value of h(5,4) for the function below?

def h(m,n):
  ans = 1
  while (n > 0):
    (ans,n) = (ans*m,n-1) 
  return(ans)


625

3. What can we say about a number n if g(n) returns True for the function g given below?

def g(n):
  for i in range(2,n):
    if n%i == 0:
       return(False)

  return(True)

 n is a prime number.

What would happen if we call gcd(m,n) with m positive and n negative in the following definition? 

4. def gcd(m,n):

    if m < n: 
        (m,n) = (n,m)

    if (m % n) == 0:
        return(n)
    else:
        diff = m-n
        return (gcd(max(n,diff),min(n,diff)))


 The behaviour depends on the exact values of m and n.
